# Weather app

https://weather-app-virid-psi.vercel.app/

This is a simple weather app. Default temperature information is for HÃ¸nefoss, with search option for cities, button for getting information for location weather as well as switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. You can also pick one of predetermined cities on top of the app(one of biggest cities in Norway). I've used react, chart.js, react-chartjs-2, luxon, OpenWeatherMap API and tailwind css for this app.

## Plans for further development

- Better error handling
- Better responsive layout and optimization for mobile devices
- Option to add your favorite cities instead of predetermined ones

### Run Locally

git clone https://github.com/PetarJovanovic/WeatherApp.git.

Go to the project directory open it and enter WeatherApp.

Before you run app locally you will have to create .env file and put your own API key, that you can create on https://openweathermap.org.

After you setup .env file you will need to run:

`npm i` and after that
`npm start` for app to run locally

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
